Who are S2 to say it is unjust ? Who are 5 people to say a law is unjust ? We have a system that says the most votes for something wins . We are the ones being oppressed by the majority that is who we are . It is our lives that are on the ballot and our rights that our being denied that is who we are . We are the ones who are being told we are second calss citizens . We are the ones who are being told are families are not families . We are the ones who are told we are less then dirt . Of course being a heterosexual S1 would not understand . S1 suggest S2 get a majority of people and change the law then . This is what happened during slavery . they actually passed 3 amendments about it . The courts are not the all knowing group of people that have enlightened minds about what is or is not fair . S2's  whole case is based on saying the majority is always be ignored if someone objects to them . S1 am in the minority when it comes to abortion . does this mean the court should listen to S1 and declare abortion illegal ? . No because abortion does not effect S1's  life personally . That iis waht we mean the courts should look at the INDIVIDUIALS life and decide upon that . If a law that the majority favors is unjust in an individuials life then it must be over ruled for the individuials sake . S2 make no sense here . S2 still fail to understand how our courts work too . S2 want them to work a certain way as opposed to the way they were created under our constitution . S1 want a society that oppresses people . If the law effects even one person adversly then it is unjust and needs to be overturned . IT only goes to prove that conservatives are heartless and want people to suffer .
@highlight
S1, a heterosexual, and S2, a homosexual, discuss the justness of the legislative process, majority rule, and how the latter affects individuals and the gay community.
@highlight
S2 describes how the gay community is discriminated against, and posits that because laws regarding homosexuals impact them more directly than the general population, it is unfair to have a majority rule apply.
@highlight
S1 accuses S2 of not understanding the legal system and proposes that S2 find majority to have legislation passed, and not look to the courts to redress the discrimination.
@highlight
S1 analogizes that process to how slavery was abolished, and also analogizes the alleged oppression to the oppression that may be felt by anti-abortion advocates and child molesters as a result of majority rule.
